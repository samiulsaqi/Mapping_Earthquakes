# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquake data using Leaflet.JS and Mapbox API

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.


## Approach

The approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library will be used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
